## Overview
- Using Oracle SQL syntax.
- Collection of queries, practices and lab I've done for **Database Principle** Course during Semester 3 of my CS degree.
- All queries were based on tables I had created on first week of the semester, in [create_tables.sql](https://github.com/chewzzz1014/sql-basics/blob/master/CSC3400-Database/create_tables.sql).

## Tables in Database
- countries
- departments
- employees
- job_grades
- job_history
- jobs
- locations
- members
- regions
